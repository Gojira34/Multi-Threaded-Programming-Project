# Multi-Threaded-Programming-Project

# Project Description
In this project, you will develop a multithreaded program to perform sorting that works as follows: A
list of integers is divided into two smaller sublists. Two separate threads (which we will term sorting
threads) sort each sublist using the selection sorting algorithm. The two sublists are then merged in the
parent thread â€”which merges the two sublists into a single sorted list.
